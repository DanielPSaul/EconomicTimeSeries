# EconomicTimeSeries
### Economic Time Series

**Concepts:** Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Machine Learning

**Software & Languages:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Microsoft Office

**Packages:** pandas, numpy, altair, matplotlib, requests, tabulate statsmodels

**Description:** This project was a simple exercise in using univariate time series models on time series data to estimate
causal effects and to forecast future values in my graduate Economic Time Series course. We were given the option to choose a topic to conduct our analysis on in which I chose the effect of increasing temperatures on housing prices in the United States. The temperature data was sourced from from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and housing price data from the FRED database. My findings determined that the causal effect is significant and the forecasted values display an increase in the relationship of both climate change and housing costs.
